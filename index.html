<p>The CANBadger is a tool for reverse-engineering and testing automotive systems. It has been developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/fjvva">Javier</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/s1ckcc">Ferdi</a> at <a href="http://www.code-white.com">Code-White</a> and was first presented at Blackhat Arsenal 2016, Defcon 24.</p>

<a id="about-the-tool" class="anchor" href="#about-the-tool" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About the tool</h2>

<p>The CANBadger has been developed to make car hacking easier and faster. At that point of time, existing tools were expensive and a lot of tools turned out to require a lot of configuration or modification. So instead, we wanted to make a cheap, open-source tool that anybody can afford, while enabling new attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle of live CAN traffic and the diagnostics security hijack. Furthermore, we wanted a tool that can run standalone, not yet another interface.
The CANBadger consists of both hardware and software. The main interface is a LPC1768/LPC1769 processor mounted on a custom PCB, which offers two CAN interfaces, SD Card, a blinky LED, some GPIO pins, power supply for peripherals and the ethernet port. With the <a href="https://github.com/Gutenshit/CANBadger-Server">CANBadger Server</a>, you can even control multiple ethernet-connected CANBadgers from your computer.</p>
