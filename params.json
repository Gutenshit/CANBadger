  "body": "## Introducing the CANBadger\r\nThe CANBadger is a tool for reverse-engineering and testing automotive systems. It has been developed by [Javier](https://twitter.com/fjvva) and [Ferdi](https://twitter.com/s1ckcc) at [Code-White](https://code-white.com) and was first presented at Blackhat Arsenal 2016, Defcon 24.\r\n## About the tool\r\nThe CANBadger has been developed to make car hacking easier and faster. At that point of time, existing tools were expensive and a lot of tools turned out to require a lot of configuration or modification. So instead, we wanted to make a cheap, open-source tool that anybody can afford, while enabling new attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle of live CAN traffic and the diagnostics security hijack. Furthermore, we wanted a tool that can run standalone, not yet another interface.\r\nThe CANBadger consists of both hardware and software. The main interface is a LPC1768/LPC1769 processor mounted on a custom PCB, which offers two CAN interfaces, SD Card, a blinky LED, some GPIO pins, power supply for peripherals and the ethernet port. With the [CANBadger Server](https://github.com/Gutenshit/CANBadger-Server), you can even control multiple ethernet-connected CANBadgers from your computer.\r\n## Project Structure\r\nYou can find the introductory slides and documentation [here](https://github.com/Gutenshit/CANBadger). For the sources of the CANBadger Server, refer to [this repository](https://github.com/Gutenshit/CANBadger-Server).  ",
